  "goals": "Since API's are such an important part of web development, I wanted to practice it a bit more. To challenge myself with this React project, I also decided to use MUI for the first time",
  "description": "JokeHub is a website on which you can find jokes from different categories. To make the app more interactive and plesant to use, I added a filter. You can use the filter to hide flagged posts, or to only show jokes of specific categories. There is also an option to fetch Jokes in different languages",
